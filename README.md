# Big-Data-College-Scorecard
Analyzing a big college data set through SQL to find a relationship between prestige, student debt, and expected future student earnings

This was originally done as a part of CS 4266: Big Data.

*Disclaimer*: The python script and the majority of the SQL Queries were solely and exclusively authored by me (as was the creation of the SQL Server for data-retrieval), but the analyis and a few SQL Queries were co-authored by Able Shi, Austin Wilms, and Kevin Yang.
